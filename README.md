# The Libraries
Here you can find all the usable libraries that are included with the official Strobe Compiler.

If you made a library, feel free to contribute it.

### Contributing
*Skip this part if you are using the built in APIs...*
* Create your own API (or use an existing one);
* Make sure your API doesn't overlap other people's APIs;
* Create a pull request to contribute your API;

*Now let's make the source files...*
* Create your own Strobe source files to "talk" with the API (using interrupts);
* Test them until you are sure that they work perfectly;
* Create a pull request to contribute your library;

### Creating APIs
For now, don't create APIs!
